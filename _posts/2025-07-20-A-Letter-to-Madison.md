To my lovely girlfriend Madison,
Thank you for encouraging me to put myself out there. Over our time together, you have built me up in such a way that I now must share my ideas with the world. You've instilled in me the conviction that I'm capable of creating great things. Whatever this website brings, even if only a medium for expression, know that you are instrumental in all of it.
I love you!
